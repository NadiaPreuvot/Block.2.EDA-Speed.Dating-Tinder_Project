# Speed Dating Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project delves into the dynamics of speed dating events to uncover what influences the decisions for matches among participants. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from speed dating events, this analysis explores the impact of various factors such as interests, career field, race, and dating frequency on the success rates of securing matches.

## Dataset Description

The dataset encompasses data gathered from speed dating events, including personal attributes, preferences, and outcomes of each dating round. Key columns include:

- **Personal Attributes**: Age, Gender, Race, Field of study, Career
- **Preferences**: Interests, Importance of attributes (Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, Shared Interests)
- **Outcomes**: Match decisions, Interest correlation, Follow-up decisions

## Analysis Goals

1. **Understand the Role of Personal Attributes**: Examine how characteristics such as race and career field influence match decisions.
2. **Evaluate the Impact of Shared Interests**: Analyze the correlation between shared interests and match outcomes.
3. **Assess the Effect of Dating Frequency**: Investigate whether the frequency of going on dates affects the likelihood of securing a match.
4. **Explore Changes in Attribute Importance**: Determine if participants' perceptions of important attributes change before and after the speed dating event.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values, normalize data formats, and prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted thorough EDA to explore the distribution of various attributes and their relationships to match outcomes.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied statistical tests to assess correlations between different factors and match decisions.
- **Visualization**: Generated insightful visualizations to illustrate findings and support conclusions.

## Key Findings

- **Influence of Race and Career on Matches**: The analysis showed minimal variation in match choices based on race, with slight disparities in match rates across different career fields.
- **Importance of Shared Interests**: There was a notable correlation between the level of shared interests and the success rate of matches.
- **Dating Frequency's Role**: Data suggested that individuals who frequently go on dates had varying success rates in speed dating, underscoring the complexity of dating preferences.

## Conclusion

The Speed Dating Analysis Project provides valuable insights into the factors that influence match decisions in speed dating events. While personal attributes and shared interests play significant roles, the results highlight the multifaceted nature of human attraction and the complexity of dating dynamics.

## Future Work

Further analysis could explore the psychological aspects of decision-making in speed dating and employ machine learning models to predict match outcomes based on participant profiles.
